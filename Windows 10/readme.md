# Windows 10 Feature Update monitoring suite
This suite of 3 monitors provides visibility on:
* **FU Status Check**: Windows 10 feature update error codes it is encountering, the failure and rollback counts
* **FU Release**: A simple Windows 10 feature update release id validation check
* **FU BCD CheckV2**: A Boot Configuration Data health check to find devices where Windows 10 has left remnants, or has left it in a bad state that is causing boot errors.
